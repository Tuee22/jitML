> **Purpose**: The committed `linux-cpu` per-lane report-card fragment that the
> always-available accelerator-free lane (Phases `13`/`14`) owns. Phase `17`
> (Sprint `17.8`) and Phase `18` (Sprint `18.1`) consume this fragment on
> `linux-cpu` as the third merge input alongside the committed `linux-cuda`
> (Phase `15`) and `apple-silicon` (Phase `16`) fragments (standards rule
> M(b)/(d)).

## Host

- Apple M1 Max workstation (macOS, arm64); Docker Desktop aarch64 Linux VM
  (47 GiB), no NVIDIA GPU. The `linux-cpu` lane runs in the `jitml:local`
  container where oneDNN (`libdnnl`, `oneapi/dnnl/dnnl.hpp`) is present.
- Validated 2026-06-23 and re-attested 2026-06-26 after the real-SL/RL chain and
  Sprint `14.3` demo-runtime replacement. The image under test was built from the worktree
  **including** the 2026-06-23 reflected-catalog-schema
  (`JitML.Service.CatalogSchema`), tuning-objective-migration
  (`JitML.SL.Architecture` seam + `pureReferenceMlpDevice`), and the three
  Sprint `14.1` browser product features (checkpoint browse, workflow-state
  reconciliation, persisted-transcript adversarial replay —
  `JitML.Service.{Transcript,WorkflowStatus}`, the new Engine workflows, and the
  `web/src/Panels/{Checkpoints,Workflow,Replay}.purs` panels), plus the Sprint
  `14.3` full-width MLP checkpoint runtime and eight seeded demo checkpoints —
  the in-image
  `check-code` gate (fourmolu + hlint + docs check + `-Werror`) passed and the
  `-fcuda` library build linked, so all of those changes are live-validated on
  this lane.

## Validation gate (all green)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `docker compose run --rm jitml jitml test all --live --linux-cpu` | 8/8 stanzas PASS (`cabal_test: passed: 8, failed: 0`) |
| `docker compose run --rm jitml jitml docs check` | ok |
| `docker compose run --rm jitml jitml check-code` | ok |
| `docker compose run --rm jitml jitml lint haskell --write` (fourmolu + hlint) | ok |
| in-image `jitml check-code` (run during `jitml bootstrap --linux-cpu` image build) | ok |

The full-stack rollout came up clean: `bootstrap/linux-cpu.sh up` completed a
**110-step** live phased rollout (all platform components Ready — MinIO, Harbor +
`harbor-pg`, Pulsar broker/bookie/zookeeper/proxy, kube-prometheus-stack,
TensorBoard, `jitml-service`, `jitml-demo`) and wrote the leased-port publication
at the Envoy edge `127.0.0.1:9091`. All **12 canonical dataset blobs** (MNIST ×4,
Fashion-MNIST ×4, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, California Housing, Tiny ImageNet) were
SHA-verified against the pinned `JitML.SL.Dataset` hashes and staged into live
MinIO via `jitml internal upload-dataset`, and the eight demo checkpoints were
seeded via `jitml internal seed-demo-checkpoints`.

`jitml-backends --linux-cpu` compiled and executed the real oneDNN primitive
paths through the Haskell FFI — every within-substrate `linux-cpu` kernel case
(identity, reduction, dense/conv/norm/attention/embedding family scaffolds,
benchmark candidate runner, tuning store, and the on-device PPO/DQN/QR-DQN/HER/
DDPG/AlphaZero trainers) a real device PASS (23/23).

  browser_product_matrix: checkpoint-backed product panels 8/8 served at edge :9091
cabal_test:

  failed: 0
```

Every measurement row is populated — **no `unavailable` product row**. The
`sl_final_loss` is real `linux-cpu` oneDNN MNIST training through
`JitML.SL.Architecture` (the four canonical MNIST blobs staged + SHA-verified).
`tune_best_objective: TPE=1.0` was produced by the **migrated** tuning objective
(now trained through the `JitML.SL.Architecture` seam, not the legacy Dense-only
classifier); the value is unchanged at `1.0` — the deterministic separable tuning
dataset still admits a 100%-accuracy trial — so the migration is live-validated on
this lane and the committed `apple-silicon` / `linux-cuda` `TPE=1.0` fragments
stay consistent.

## Browser product matrix — `15/15` via live Playwright

The live Playwright product matrix ran against the `linux-cpu` Envoy edge
(`http://127.0.0.1:9091/`) after `jitml internal seed-demo-checkpoints`, via the
`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.49.1-noble` browser image (host networking),
exit `0`. The matrix is **15 tests**: the 11 baseline panels, the three
**Sprint `14.1` net-new browser product features** (checkpoint browse,
live-backed workflow-state reconciliation, and persisted-transcript adversarial
replay), plus the adversarial-game selector coverage added for Sprint `14.3`:

```
15 passed
(15/15 — exit 0)
  ✓ demo shell responds and renders the portals home
  ✓ portals home links to every bundled admin portal
  ✓ shared header is present on every panel
  ✓ mnist panel renders an inference canvas          (kind: InferenceResult)
  ✓ generic inference panel renders checkpoint output (kind: GenericInferenceResult)
  ✓ cifar panel renders an upload control            (kind: ImageInferenceResult)
  ✓ checkpoint compare panel renders output deltas   (kind: CheckpointCompareResult)
  ✓ connect4 panel renders the board                 (kind: AdversarialMoveResult)
  ✓ adversarial panel selector exercises seeded games/checkpoints
  ✓ checkpoint browse panel lists seeded checkpoints  (kind: CheckpointList)
  ✓ workflow status panel renders a live status table (kind: WorkflowStatus)    [NEW 14.1]
  ✓ transcript replay scrubs a persisted adversarial game (real MinIO transcript)[NEW 14.1]
  ✓ rl panel renders an episode timeline
  ✓ training panel renders a loss curve
  ✓ tune panel renders the trial heatmap
```

The checkpoint-backed panels now submit user-derived inputs and parse full
Engine-backed result frames. The report-card `browser_product_matrix` **8/8**
probe independently confirms every seeded checkpoint-backed product panel serves
its result kind. The three Sprint `14.1` features are real and live-backed:
**checkpoint browse** lists the seeded checkpoints from MinIO via a
`ListCheckpoints` Engine workflow; **workflow status** renders reconciled
`WorkflowStatus` frames the Engine projects to `workflow.status.<substrate>`; and
**transcript replay** scrubs a game's moves read back from a real persisted
`jitml-transcripts` MinIO object (the persisted `.cbor` object is confirmed in the
bucket). The matrix exits `0` — **all 15 pass**.
