> **Purpose**: oneDNN Layer Kernels for Training. Single-session phase migrated from legacy Sprint 23.2 in the 2026-07-24 phase-per-session renumber; see the old→new map in [README.md](README.md).

## Phase State

📋 **Planned**. Active frontier — the lowest-numbered phase not yet Done.

## Sprint 234.1: oneDNN Layer Kernels for Training [📋 Planned]

**Status**: Planned
**Implementation**: `src/JitML/Codegen/OneDnn.hs`, `src/JitML/Numerics/LayerGraphOneDnn.hs`, `src/JitML/Numerics/MlpOneDnn.hs`, `src/JitML/Numerics/MlpDevice.hs`, `src/JitML/Engines/OneDnnRuntime.hs`, `test/backends/Main.hs`
**Docs to update**: `../documents/engineering/jit_codegen_architecture.md`, `../documents/engineering/numerical_core.md`

### Objective

Wire the layer graph's parameterized forward pre-activation and backward
parameter/input-gradient operations to generated oneDNN kernels through the JIT
device. `src/JitML/Codegen/OneDnn.hs` renders the training ABI, and
`src/JitML/Numerics/LayerGraphOneDnn.hs` binds it to the pure `Autodiff` tape so
the backend computes update-critical gradients rather than only the pure oracle.

### Deliverables

- `src/JitML/Codegen/OneDnn.hs` renders a layer-graph training shared object
  with a stable `jitml_layer_forward`, `jitml_layer_backward_data`, and
  `jitml_layer_backward_weights` ABI. Dense and other affine graph nodes execute
  oneDNN matmul primitives; `Conv2D` and `Conv3D` execute real
  `convolution_forward` (`forward_training`),
  `convolution_backward_data`, and `convolution_backward_weights` primitives
  over the graph's flat 1x1 channel projection.
- `JitML.Numerics.LayerGraphOneDnn` dispatches each parameterized layer node to
  that generated oneDNN ABI, reusing the pure `Autodiff` tape for activation,
  residual, and parameterless graph semantics. The returned evidence records the
  backend, artifact, and primitive name used for every parameterized node.
- A backends test asserts backend-vs-pure-oracle agreement within tolerance for
  every layer node's forward and backward, and records that the oneDNN device
  executed the update-critical operations (device evidence for the product row).
- Runtime absence of `libdnnl` fails the lane up front; no layer kernel passes
  vacuously.

### Remaining Work

- Lower the single executable Sprint `233.1` graph to exact oneDNN forward,
  parameter-gradient, and input-gradient semantics for every supported node.
- Compare those kernels with an independent finite-difference oracle and reject
  unsupported layout/shape cases instead of reusing an approximation.

### Validation

```bash
docker compose run --rm jitml jitml test jitml-backends --linux-cpu
docker compose run --rm jitml jitml test jitml-unit --linux-cpu
docker compose run --rm jitml jitml check-code
```

### Historical Validation

The initial 2026-07-02 backend comparison was withdrawn when the audit found
that its reference shared the same dense approximation. The 2026-07-06
reclosure moved Conv2D/Conv3D update-critical work through real oneDNN
convolution training primitives and compared the backend against the corrected
per-kind reference algebra. The retained validation is summarized in
[Phase State](#phase-state); absence of `libdnnl` still fails the lane up front.
