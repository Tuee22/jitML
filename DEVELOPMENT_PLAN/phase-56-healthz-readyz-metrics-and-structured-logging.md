# Phase 56: `/healthz` / `/readyz` / `/metrics` and Structured Logging

> **Purpose**: /healthz / /readyz / /metrics and Structured Logging. Single-session phase migrated from legacy Sprint 5.3 in the 2026-07-24 phase-per-session renumber; see the old→new map in [README.md](README.md).

## Phase State

✅ **Done**.

## Sprint 56.1: `/healthz` / `/readyz` / `/metrics` and Structured Logging [✅ Done]

**Status**: Done
**Implementation**: `src/JitML/Service/Endpoints.hs`,
`src/JitML/Service/Logger.hs`, `src/JitML/Service/Retry.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/daemon_architecture.md`

### Objective

Expose the endpoint response, metrics, retry, structured-log renderers, and
local HTTP route server that the daemon serves in-process.

### Deliverables

- Current `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics` are renderable
  `EndpointResponse` values served by `JitML.Service.Http` through
  `daemonHttpRoutes`.
- Target `/healthz` returns `200 OK` if the daemon process is alive; `500`
  otherwise.
- Target `/readyz` returns `200 OK` only after the `Ready` lifecycle phase
  (capability classes acquired, prerequisite reconcile passed, Pulsar
  consumer subscribed); `503` otherwise.
- Target `/metrics` exposes Prometheus format scraped by the kube-prometheus-stack
  scrape config from Sprint `4.5`. Metrics include per-topic consumer lag,
  per-bucket PUT/GET latency histograms, JIT cache hit/miss counts, Lifecycle
  phase counters.
- `Logger` renders structured JSON values with fields `ts`, `level`, `msg`,
  `lifecyclePhase`, `daemonId`, plus typed event payload. The operational stderr
  sink and dynamic filter are Sprint `12.16` obligations and are not claimed by
  this pure-renderer sprint.
- `RecoverableError` vs `FatalError` classification maps service failures into
  typed application errors. Sprint `5.4` retains the pure `RetryPolicy`
  interpreter; Sprint `12.16` owns its production daemon reader and structured
  fatal diagnostics.

### Validation

1. `jitml service` renders health, readiness, and metrics response summaries.
2. `cabal test jitml-daemon-lifecycle` exercises endpoint status codes and
   retry behavior against synthetic service errors.
3. `cabal test jitml-daemon-lifecycle` exercises the one-shot HTTP listener
   against `/healthz`.

## Documentation Requirements

**Engineering docs to create/update:**

- None (single-session phase migrated in the 2026-07-24 renumber; evidence lives in the Validation gate above).

**Product docs to create/update:**

- None.

**Cross-references to add:**

- None.
