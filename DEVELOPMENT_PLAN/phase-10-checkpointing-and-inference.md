> **Purpose**: Stand up the checkpoint and inference surface:
> split-blob object-key renderers, a small typed manifest, pure pointer-CAS
> decisions, a local deterministic CBOR manifest codec/content hash, a
> binary `.jmw1` encoder, a filesystem-backed local checkpoint store,
> `jitml internal gc` summary output, and deterministic inference summaries.
> Live MinIO effects, retention traversal, and
> kernel-handle loading remain target runtime work.

## Phase Status

🔄 **Active**. The phase owns
[Exit Definition](README.md#exit-definition) item 7 (split-blob `.jmw1`
format with the typed manifest, inference-only read path, bit-determinism
contract holding within the per-substrate ULP tolerance methodology).
**Met today**: the typed `CheckpointManifest` now carries the full
split-blob shape (weights, optimizer state, RNG streams, monotonic
`manifestStep`, per-metric values, parent-manifest lineage SHA);
`emptyManifest` is the convenience builder. The split-blob object-key
renderers, deterministic manifest CBOR codec (with canonical
ordering across tensors / optimizer parts / RNG parts / metrics),
`manifestContentSha`, `.jmw1` encoder, pointer-CAS decision surface,
and the filesystem-backed local checkpoint store with
`inferFromManifest` / `inferFromLatestCheckpoint` /
`inferWeightsOnlyFromLatestCheckpoint` are all in place. The typed
`AdvancePredicate` ADT (`AdvanceLatest`, `AdvanceBestMaximised`,
`AdvanceBestMinimised`) and `applyAdvancePredicate` evaluate the
typed CAS predicates from README → Concurrency model.
`deriveExperimentHash resolvedDhall substrateFingerprint` computes
`sha256(resolved-dhall || substrate-fingerprint)`. The GC
reconciler surface (`RetentionPolicy`, `walkLiveSet`,
`applyRetentionPolicy`, `buildGcPlan`, `GcEvent`) implements
`LastN k` retention with always-live best/trial pointer targets,
`gc_reaped` event materialisation, and a second-invocation no-op
detection. **Unmet today**: Sprints `10.2`–`10.4` still owe live
MinIO `If-None-Match` / `If-Match` effects through `HasMinIO`, the
live `gc_reaped` Pulsar publish, the live `loadInferenceCheckpoint`
KernelHandle FFI load, and the per-substrate ULP tolerance measured
from real cross-substrate runs. Detailed remaining work lives in
each sprint's `### Remaining Work` block below.

### Current Implementation Scope

The worktree implements a `CheckpointManifest`, `TensorBlob`, optimizer/RNG
blob metadata, split-blob object-key renderers, pointer-CAS decisions,
`manifestPointer`, deterministic `encodeManifestCbor` / `decodeManifestCbor`
/ `manifestContentSha`, binary `encodeJmw1` encoder with `JMW1` magic, CBOR
header length, and little-endian `F64` payload bytes, plus
`inferFromManifest`. `src/JitML/Checkpoint/Store.hs` adds a local
object-store interpreter for write-once payloads, manifest writes/reads,
latest pointer CAS, inference from the latest checkpoint, retention planning,
`HasMinIO`-backed GC execution, and `HasMinIO`-backed inference checkpoint
loading covered by the filesystem-backed instance. Live HTTP MinIO effects,
live `gc_reaped` Pulsar publishing, kernel-handle loading, and real
demo/frontend checkpoint reads live in the sprints' `### Remaining Work`
blocks below.

## Phase Summary

This phase currently delivers the local checkpoint manifest, split-blob key,
pointer-CAS, deterministic manifest CBOR, local write-once object store, latest
pointer read path, and inference summary helpers. The target persistence layer
still uses MinIO bucket `jitml-checkpoints`, write-once blobs, If-Match CAS
pointers, and the split-blob `.jmw1` binary format; the standalone live MinIO
capability path is available through `JitML.Service.MinIOSubprocess`, while the
checkpoint store still needs live wiring. The live implementation proceeds
storage-outward: conditional checkpoint writes/reads first, then
inference from checkpoint, then training persistence, then tuning/resume
semantics.

## Sprint 10.1: Storage Layout and Split-Blob Schema 🔄

**Status**: Active
**Implementation**: `src/JitML/Checkpoint/Format.hs`,
`src/JitML/Storage/Buckets.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/checkpoint_format.md`

### Objective

Establish the manifest shape, bucket pointer string, and
split-blob object-key renderers used by the inference summary surface.

### Deliverables

- `TensorBlob` carries `tensorName`, `tensorShape`, and `tensorBlobKey`.
- `CheckpointManifest` carries `manifestId`, `manifestExperiment`, and a list
  of `TensorBlob` values.
- `manifestPointer` renders the current simplified pointer path
  `jitml-checkpoints/<experiment>/<manifest>.manifest.cbor`.
- `blobKey`, `manifestKey`, `latestPointerKey`, `bestPointerKey`, and
  `trialPointerKey` render the split-blob object layout under
  `jitml-checkpoints/<experiment-hash>/`.
- `src/JitML/Storage/Buckets.hs` enumerates the `jitml-checkpoints` bucket
  among the local MinIO bucket names.
- `CheckpointManifest` carries `manifestOptimizer :: [OptimizerBlob]`,
  `manifestRng :: [RngBlob]`, `manifestStep :: Word64`,
  `manifestMetrics :: [(Text, Double)]`, and `manifestParentManifestSha`.
- `deriveExperimentHash resolvedDhall substrateFingerprint` computes
  the canonical `sha256(resolved-dhall || substrate-fingerprint)`
  used as the bucket prefix and pointer-key key.
- Live MinIO bucket-layout validation remains target work owned by
  Sprint 4.3.

### Validation

1. `src/JitML/Checkpoint/Format.hs` exposes the `TensorBlob`,
   `CheckpointManifest`, and `manifestPointer` helpers.
2. `cabal test jitml-cross-backend` exercises the manifest-based inference
   helper.
3. `jitml-unit` verifies the split-key renderers.
4. Live validation (target): a real MinIO bucket holds blobs and
   manifests under the addressed split-blob paths after a real training
   step; `experiment-hash` is derived from the resolved Dhall and
   referenced by both the bucket prefix and the pointer key.

### Remaining Work

- Validate the bucket layout against a live MinIO instance through
  `JitML.Service.MinIOSubprocess`. The typed split-blob
  layout (`OptimizerBlob`, `RngBlob`, `manifestStep`,
  `manifestMetrics`, `manifestParentManifestSha`) and the experiment
  hash derivation are in place; the gap is checkpoint-store use of the
  live `HasMinIO` client after a real training step.

## Sprint 10.2: `.jmw1` Wire Format and Manifest CBOR 🔄

**Status**: Active
**Implementation**: `src/JitML/Checkpoint/Format.hs`,
`src/JitML/Checkpoint/Store.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/checkpoint_format.md`

### Objective

Land the current `.jmw1` encoder, local deterministic manifest CBOR codec,
manifest-content SHA helper, local pointer-CAS decision surface, and local
write-once object-store interpreter. Live MinIO conditional-write effects
remain target runtime validation.

### Deliverables

- `encodeJmw1` emits a lazy bytestring beginning with `JMW1`, followed by a
  little-endian 32-bit CBOR header length, a CBOR header, and little-endian
  `Double` payload bytes.
- `encodeManifestCbor` canonicalizes tensor order by name and serializes the
  current `CheckpointManifest`.
- `decodeManifestCbor` round-trips the manifest representation.
- `manifestContentSha` hashes the deterministic manifest CBOR bytes.
- `PointerWrite`, `PointerWriteResult`, and `applyPointerWrite` model the local
  CAS decision used by the eventual MinIO pointer writer.
- `JitML.Checkpoint.Store` writes blob and manifest objects if absent, advances
  the latest pointer through `applyPointerWrite`, and reads manifests by content
  SHA from a local filesystem root.
- The typed `AdvancePredicate` ADT (`AdvanceLatest`,
  `AdvanceBestMaximised "<metric>"`, `AdvanceBestMinimised
  "<metric>"`) plus `applyAdvancePredicate` evaluate the typed CAS
  predicates from README → Concurrency model. Live MinIO
  conditional-write effects remain target runtime validation.

### Validation

1. `encodeJmw1` emits the expected `JMW1` marker, CBOR header length, and
   little-endian `Double` payload bytes.
2. `jitml-unit` verifies deterministic manifest CBOR encoding/decoding and
   content hashing.
3. `jitml-unit` verifies successful and conflicting pointer-CAS decisions.
4. `jitml-unit` verifies the checkpoint store writes objects/manifests
   and reads the latest inference path.
5. Live validation (target): `putBlobIfAbsent` against MinIO returns the
   blob's ETag on first write and `SEConflict` on subsequent identical
   PUTs through `If-None-Match: *`; `applyPointerWrite` against MinIO
   honours `If-Match: <etag>` and surfaces `412` as `SEConflict`; the
   retry harness backs off per the typed `RetryPolicy`.

### Remaining Work

- Wire the checkpoint-store put-blob-if-absent and pointer-CAS paths through
  `JitML.Service.MinIOSubprocess`, the live HTTP-backed `HasMinIO`
  capability from Sprint `4.3` / `5.4`.
- Add integration coverage in `jitml-integration` (Sprint `12.2`) that
  exercises the CAS retry against a live MinIO instance.

## Sprint 10.3: Bit-Determinism Contract and Retention Reconciler 🔄

**Status**: Active
**Implementation**: `src/JitML/App.hs`, `src/JitML/Plan/Plan.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/determinism_contract.md`,
`documents/engineering/checkpoint_format.md`

### Objective

Land the determinism documentation tie-in and `jitml internal gc`
summary surface; grow real retention graph traversal and MinIO deletion
per `### Remaining Work` below.

### Deliverables

- `documents/engineering/determinism_contract.md` records the target
  same-substrate and cross-substrate tolerance methodology.
- `jitml internal gc <experiment-hash> --dry-run` renders a generic
  Plan/Apply retention plan.
- Normal `jitml internal gc <experiment-hash>` currently prints the local
  retention summary (`gc: <experiment-hash> kept=<n> reaped=<n>`) and exits
  `3` on a no-op plan through `AppError ReconcilerNoop`.
- `JitML.Checkpoint.Store.{walkLiveSet,applyRetentionPolicy,buildGcPlan}`
  implement the pointer live-set traversal across the `latest` chain
  and `best/<m>` / `trial/<...>` always-live pointer targets,
  `LastN k` retention application, blob-reap event materialisation
  (`GcEvent` records the manifest SHA, blob SHAs, experiment hash,
  and step), and the steady-state no-op detection
  (`gcNoOp` flag flips when there are no reap events). Live blob
  deletion through MinIO + Pulsar `gc_reaped` publish remain target
  runtime work.

### Validation

1. `jitml internal gc <experiment-hash> --dry-run` emits the typed plan.
2. `jitml internal gc <experiment-hash>` prints the reconciliation
   summary.
3. Live validation (target): the bit-determinism contract is verified by
   `jitml-cross-backend` running real cross-substrate cohorts and the
   resulting per-tensor drift fitting the committed ULP tolerance band;
   `jitml internal gc` traverses the pointer live set, applies a `LastN`
   retention policy, reaps unreferenced blobs from MinIO, emits
   `gc_reaped` events, and exits `3` when the cluster is already at the
   target retention state.

### Remaining Work

- Emit `gc_reaped` Pulsar events for each delete and validate the
  deletion path against live HTTP MinIO once Sprint `4.3` / `5.4`
  lands the real client.
- Add the per-substrate ULP tolerance measurement to
  `documents/engineering/determinism_contract.md` based on real
  cross-substrate runs from Sprint `12.6`.

## Sprint 10.4: Inference-Only Read Path 🔄

**Status**: Active
**Implementation**: `src/JitML/Checkpoint/Format.hs`,
`src/JitML/Checkpoint/Store.hs`,
`src/JitML/App.hs`
**Docs to update**: `documents/engineering/checkpoint_format.md`,
`documents/engineering/daemon_architecture.md`

### Objective

Land the current inference-only summary helper consumed by local command and
test bodies, plus the local latest-pointer → manifest → inference read path.
Live MinIO pointer reads, live manifest fetches, and kernel-handle loading
remain target runtime work.

### Deliverables

- `inferFromManifest` adds a deterministic bias derived from the number of
  manifest tensors to each input value.
- `inferFromLatestCheckpoint` reads the latest pointer from the local checkpoint
  store, fetches the addressed manifest, and runs the deterministic inference
  helper.
- `jitml inference run` constructs a small local manifest and prints the
  deterministic inference summary.
- `jitml inspect replay <manifest-sha>` is registered and currently prints a
  command summary from `src/JitML/App.hs`.
- `inferWeightsOnlyFromLatestCheckpoint` reads the latest pointer,
  fetches the manifest, drops `manifestOptimizer` / `manifestRng`
  parts (the inference path doesn't need them), and runs
  `inferFromManifest`. The typed `weightOnlyTensors` predicate
  selects the inference subset of the manifest.
- Live `loadInferenceCheckpoint` against MinIO + the FFI kernel
  handle load through `JitML.Engines.Local` remain target runtime
  work.

### Validation

1. `cabal test jitml-cross-backend` exercises `inferFromManifest` across
   the substrate list.
2. `jitml-unit` exercises `inferFromLatestCheckpoint` against the
   checkpoint store.
3. `jitml inference run experiments/mnist.dhall` prints the deterministic
   inference summary.
4. Live validation (target): `jitml inference run` reads the latest
   pointer from MinIO bucket `jitml-checkpoints/<experiment-hash>/`,
   fetches the addressed manifest, loads weight-only blobs (no optimizer
   parts), loads the substrate-bound `KernelHandle` from the JIT cache,
   and runs real inference against the loaded weights.

### Remaining Work

- Validate `JitML.Checkpoint.Store.loadInferenceCheckpoint` against
  `JitML.Service.MinIOSubprocess`, the live HTTP-backed MinIO client from
  Sprint `4.3` / `5.4`.
- Wire FFI `KernelHandle` loading through `JitML.Engines.Local` (and
  the future per-substrate engines) so inference actually executes the
  generated kernel.
- Extend `jitml inspect replay <manifest-sha>` from the current local
  checkpoint store path to live MinIO manifests through
  `JitML.Service.MinIOSubprocess`.
