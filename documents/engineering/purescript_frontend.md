## Stack

| Component | Current status | Owning module / path |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| PureScript entrypoint | Halogen panel dispatcher keyed by URL hash; empty / unmatched hash routes to the portals home; hash transitions dispose the previous Halogen root before mounting the next panel | `web/src/Main.purs` |
| npm scripts | `build`, `test`, `format` wrappers plus checked-in Spago project | `web/package.json`, `web/spago.yaml` |
| Contract renderer | Local bridge-compatible renderer | `src/JitML/Web/Contracts.hs` |
| Generated contracts | Checked-in generated file protected by `trackingGeneratedPaths` | `web/src/Generated/Contracts.purs` |
| Admin-portal emitter | Bridge-compatible emitter for the bundled admin-portal directory; derived from the `routeAdminPortalLabel` metadata on the route registry | `src/JitML/Web/AdminPortals.hs` |
| Generated admin portals | Checked-in generated file protected by `trackingGeneratedPaths` | `web/src/Generated/AdminPortals.purs` |
| Bundle/panel/demo-route metadata | Local Haskell metadata | `src/JitML/Web/Bundle.hs` |
| Shared chrome | Slim header (`jitML` wordmark + `[home]` link to `#portals`) rendered by every panel | `web/src/Chrome/Header.purs` |
| SPA panel registry | Single hand-maintained list of demo panels consumed by both `Main.purs` and the portals home | `web/src/PanelRegistry.purs` |
| Portals home panel | Two-column directory composing `PanelRegistry.panels` with `Generated.AdminPortals.adminPortals`; default empty-hash landing | `web/src/Panels/Portals.purs` |
| Demo HTTP routes | Haskell HTTP server for API routes, compiled bundle serving, and live WebSocket bridge | `src/JitML/Web/Server.hs` |
| PureScript smoke file | Spec smoke file covering generated contracts and panel modules through the Node `spec-node` runner | `web/test/Main.purs` |
| Panel payload modules | Six typed Halogen panels with REST or live WebSocket actions | `web/src/Panels/{Mnist,Cifar,Connect4,Rl,Training,Tune}.purs` |
| Playwright | Live-only spec covering the portals home, the per-panel shared header, every admin-portal link, the six canonical panels, and real REST response/rendered-value updates for MNIST, CIFAR, and Connect 4; no inline DOM fallback remains | `playwright/jitml-demo.spec.ts`, `src/JitML/Test/LivePlan.hs`, `test/e2e/Main.hs` |
| Demo executable | Status line plus HTTP/WebSocket server | `app/Demo.hs`, `src/JitML/App.hs` |

The PureScript stack is project-specific (the doctrine does not address
browser-side code). Npm / Spago / Playwright invocations flow through
the typed `Subprocess` boundary from doctrine `Architecture → Subprocesses as
Typed Values`; the checked-in Cabal bodies perform local smoke checks,
validate the `spago test`, `purs-tidy check`, and Playwright command shapes,
and keep the live browser run on the explicit live orchestration path.
`web/spago.yaml` keeps `spec` and `spec-node` in the test dependency set, and
`web/test/Main.purs` uses `Test.Spec.Runner.Node.runSpecAndExitProcess` so
Node-local smoke runs exit with the real test status without the deprecated
generic `runSpec` compatibility alias. The runner's `.spec-results` file is
ignored under `web/.gitignore`.

Build output under `web/dist/` is generated, not checked in. The Docker image
build runs `spago build --output dist` and esbuilds `dist/Main/index.js` into
the browser-loadable `web/dist/Main/bundle.js` served by `jitml-demo`.

## Current Local Surface

The current worktree contains `web/src/Main.purs`, generated
`web/src/Generated/Contracts.purs`, six Halogen panel modules under
`web/src/Panels/`, `web/test/Main.purs`, `src/JitML/Web/Contracts.hs`, and
`src/JitML/Web/Bundle.hs`. `Web.Bundle` records the bundle output paths, the
six canonical panel surfaces, the `demoStatusLine`, and the demo route
manifest for `/`, `/api`, `/api/inference`, `/api/images`,
`/api/connect4/move`, `/api/ws`, `/api/ws/training`, `/api/ws/rl`, and
`/api/ws/tune`. `web/src/Main.purs` dispatches through the SPA
`PanelRegistry`, stores the active Halogen disposer, and runs it before
mounting the next hash-selected panel so navigation does not leave
duplicate roots attached. `src/JitML/Web/Server.hs` serves the same HTTP surface,
returns `503` for plain stream GETs that do not upgrade to WebSocket, and
bridges upgraded `/api/ws*` clients to live Pulsar event topics.

## Browser-Contract ADTs

`src/JitML/Web/Contracts.hs` is the **source of truth** for every ADT
crossed by the REST / WebSocket surface. The current local renderer produces
`web/src/Generated/Contracts.purs` and identifies itself as
`local-purescript-bridge-compatible-renderer`. The generated contract path is
an active `trackingGeneratedPaths` entry; hand edits fail `jitml docs check`.

The current endpoint metadata covers:

- `RunCommand` at `POST /api/runs/{runId}/command`
- `InferenceRun` at `POST /api/inference`
- `UploadImage` at `POST /api/images`
- `Connect4Move` at `POST /api/connect4/move`
- `MetricsStream` at `GET /api/ws`
- `TrainingStream` at `GET /api/ws/training`
- `RlStream` at `GET /api/ws/rl`
- `TuneStream` at `GET /api/ws/tune`

Richer typed training, RL, AlphaZero, inference, image-upload, Connect 4, and
tuning payload ADTs remain target browser-contract work.

## Panels

Every panel renders inside `Chrome.Header.render` (the slim shared header — `jitML` wordmark plus `[home]` link to `#portals`), so the directory is one click away from any panel view. `Main.purs`'s empty-hash fallback routes to the portals home; the named hashes below continue to address each panel directly. Panel mounts return their Halogen disposer to the hash dispatcher, which runs the previous disposer before mounting a new route. The portals home is itself a `Panels.Portals` Halogen component composing `PanelRegistry.panels` (left column) with `Generated.AdminPortals.adminPortals` (right column), the latter generated from `src/JitML/Routes.hs` via `JitML.Web.AdminPortals` so the registry remains the single source of truth.

`Panels.Api.requestText` is the dependency-free text request bridge used by the
REST panels. MNIST, CIFAR/ImageNet, and Connect 4 issue real `POST` calls to the
generated endpoint paths and convert the text replies into the panel-specific
typed response records before updating Halogen state. `Panels.Stream` opens the
live WebSocket route, reports connection failures through typed actions, and the
RL/training/tune panels convert incoming frame text into typed stream records
instead of storing raw frame strings.

| Panel | URL hash | REST handler | WebSocket subscription |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Portals home (default) | `#portals` (empty hash) | — | — |
| MNIST | `#mnist-live-inference` | `POST /api/inference` | — |
| CIFAR / ImageNet | `#cifar-imagenet-upload` | `POST /api/images` | — |
| Connect 4 | `#connect4-human-vs-alphazero` | `POST /api/connect4/move` | — |
| RL trajectory | `#rl-trajectory` | — | `/api/ws/rl` (proxies `rl.event.<mode>`) |
| Training | `#training-progress` | — | `/api/ws/training` (proxies `training.event.<mode>`) |
| Tune | `#hyperparameter-sweep` | — | `/api/ws/tune` (proxies `tune.event.<mode>`) |

## REST and WebSocket Surface

The HTTP handlers live in `src/JitML/Web/Server.hs`; they provide responses for
the API index, inference, image top-k classification, Connect 4 move, compiled
bundle serving, and live stream routes. A stream route requested as plain HTTP
returns `503 live stream requires WebSocket upgrade`; upgraded clients are
bridged to Pulsar event topics by `liveDemoWebSocketRoutes`.

| Surface | Method | Path | Payload type |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|
| Inference | POST | `/api/inference` | `InferenceRun` |
| Image upload | POST | `/api/images` | `UploadImage` |
| Connect 4 move | POST | `/api/connect4/move` | `Connect4Move` |
| Live event WS | GET | `/api/ws`, `/api/ws/training`, `/api/ws/rl`, `/api/ws/tune` | typed event envelopes |
| Checkpoint browse | GET | `/api/checkpoints/<experiment-hash>` | manifest list (cross-link to TB sidecars) |

## `jitml-demo` HTTP Server

`app/Demo.hs` is a six-line shim into `App.demoMain`. The current `demoMain`
prints `demoStatusLine` from `src/JitML/Web/Bundle.hs`:
`jitml-demo: serving generated frontend contract surface`, then starts the
low-level HTTP/WebSocket listener from `src/JitML/Web/Server.hs`. It serves the
current route/API surface, `/bundle/main.js` from `web/dist/Main/bundle.js`
when the bundle exists, and the held-open `/api/ws*` WebSocket bridge. When no
live publication exists the bridge sends a terminal error frame instead of an
offline deterministic stream.

The `Deployment/jitml-demo` template (Sprint `4.1`) is populated with the
demo image, `jitml-demo` command, and explicit `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 80`
arguments so Envoy can reach the pod IP. HTTPRoutes for `/`, `/api`, `/api/ws`
(Sprint `3.4`) point at `jitml-demo:80`.

## Playwright E2E

`playwright/jitml-demo.spec.ts` is the current TypeScript Playwright scaffold.
`JitML.Test.LivePlan` records the target `npx playwright test` step after the
Helm dependency build and the `jitml bootstrap` ephemeral-cluster rollout. The
default `jitml-e2e` Cabal body validates that typed Playwright command shape
without starting the live stack. The checked-in spec is live-only: it reads
`.build/runtime/cluster-publication.json`, navigates to the published edge
route, and fails fast when no live publication exists. The matrix covers the
smoke shell plus the six canonical panels:

- Portals home: load the empty-hash root and assert both the panels
  column (`#jitml-portals-panels`) and the admin-portals column
  (`#jitml-portals-admin`) mount, plus every admin-portal link carries
  the expected root-relative `href` matching the route registry.
- Shared header: for each named panel hash, assert `#jitml-chrome`
  mounts and the `#jitml-chrome-home` anchor links to `#portals`.
- MNIST: load the inference panel, assert its canvas mounts, click Predict,
  wait for `POST /api/inference`, verify the real response contains the
  policy/value output, and assert the rendered prediction badge updates.
- CIFAR: load the upload panel, click Classify, wait for `POST /api/images`,
  and assert the response plus attached result-list surface.
- Connect 4: load the AlphaZero-vs-human panel, click a column, wait for
  `POST /api/connect4/move`, and assert the rendered move list includes the
  returned MCTS move.
- RL trajectory: load the trajectory panel through the live edge route.
- Training / Tune: load the streaming metric panels through the live edge
  route.

Playwright execution runs through the typed `Subprocess` boundary on the
explicit live orchestration path; it belongs to the doctrine's
Ephemeral-Cluster Infrastructure test category and does not have its own Cabal
stanza. Static route/API scaffold checks stay in the local Haskell e2e and
PureScript lint targets.
The 2026-06-11 CUDA-machine run used
`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.49.1-noble` with host networking against the
published `linux-cuda` edge and passed **9 / 9**.
The local PureScript smoke suite is `purescript-spec` executed through
`spec-node` by `spago test`; Playwright remains live-only and separate from the
default Cabal matrix.
