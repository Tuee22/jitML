## Doctrine Deferrals

This doc defers to [../../HASKELL_CLI_TOOL.md](../../HASKELL_CLI_TOOL.md) for:

- **Testing Doctrine** — every behavioural surface gated by a stanza; no
  spanning `tasty` tree.
- **Standard Testing Stack** — Cabal + `exitcode-stdio-1.0` + `tasty` +
  `tasty-hunit` + `tasty-quickcheck` + `tasty-golden` + `typed-process` +
  `temporary` + Pulumi + `fourmolu` + `hlint` + `cabal format`.
- **Test Categories** — Pure Logic, Parser, Property, Golden, Integration,
  Daemon Lifecycle, Pulumi-Orchestrated Infrastructure.
- **Test Organization** — one `test-suite` stanza per tier with `type:
  exitcode-stdio-1.0` and `tasty` as the in-stanza runner; project-specific
  stanzas under §Test Organization → project-specific stanzas.

## jitML Stanzas

The ten Cabal test-suite stanzas are declared in `jitml.cabal`. Current bodies
exercise the local deterministic contracts for their owning surfaces while live
cluster validation remains phase-gated:

| Stanza | Current body | Final Tier | Owning Sprint |
|--------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| `jitml-unit` | `test/unit/Main.hs` covers current CLI, docs, prerequisite, env, app-error, plan, subprocess, bootstrap-script, cache, hot-reload, capability, RL framework, AlphaZero, tuning resume, checkpoint key/CAS/store, TensorBoard scalar-event codec / TFRecord writer / sidecar, Grafana fixture, and frontend bundle/panel/demo-route surfaces | Pure Logic + Parser + Property + Golden | Sprint 12.1 |
| `jitml-integration` | `test/integration/Main.hs` covers typed subprocess execution, bootstrap/live-rollout renderers, route-table golden fixture, real-binary spawn matrix, filesystem-backed `HasMinIO` checkpoint / inference / resume coverage, local Linux CPU checkpoint inference through a generated FFI kernel, routed MinIO/Pulsar subprocess command rendering including the WebSocket subscribe probe, substrate-scoped Pulsar topic bootstrap, BootConfig-derived daemon client settings, two-worker Kind rendering, required `jitml-service` anti-affinity plus single-worker rollout strategy/RBAC rendering, Dhall numerics decode, and typed service command shapes | Integration | Sprint 12.2 |
| `jitml-sl-canonicals` | `test/sl-canonicals/Main.hs` covers deterministic supervised canonical curves and the committed per-problem fixtures under `test/golden/sl/` | Integration (project-specific) | Sprint 12.3 |
| `jitml-rl-canonicals` | `test/rl-canonicals/Main.hs` covers the RL algorithm catalog, deterministic trajectories, PPO/CartPole golden trajectory, and AlphaZero transcript fixtures for Connect 4, Othello, Hex, and Gomoku | Integration (project-specific) | Sprint 12.4 |
| `jitml-hyperparameter` | `test/hyperparameter/Main.hs` covers sampler / scheduler / pruner axes including TPE, deterministic trial generation, the TPE worked-example Dhall decode, and Sobol/GA golden fixtures | Integration (project-specific) | Sprint 12.5 |
| `jitml-cross-backend` | `test/cross-backend/Main.hs` covers per-substrate engine determinism flags, checkpoint inference parity, and generated Linux CPU identity/reduction-smoke kernel compile/load/run | Integration (project-specific) | Sprint 12.6 |
| `jitml-daemon-lifecycle` | `test/daemon-lifecycle/Main.hs` covers lifecycle ordering, endpoints, retry policy, at-least-once deduplication, fully-qualified Pulsar topic routing, BootConfig-derived daemon subscription planning, startup subscription acquisition through the combined daemon client interpreter, bounded acquired-subscription consumer batches, LiveConfig-derived handler-router dedup cache sizing, daemon runtime summary rendering including `pulsar_subscriptions` / `pulsar_subscription_status`, and one-shot daemon HTTP serving | Daemon Lifecycle | Sprint 12.7 |
| `jitml-e2e` | `test/e2e/Main.hs` covers route, bucket, publication, browser-contract, demo HTTP including generated stream routes, deployment, report-card, no leaked `jitml-e2e-*` clusters when `kind` and `/var/run/docker.sock` are available, and typed live-plan surfaces | Pulumi-Orchestrated Infrastructure | Sprint 12.8 |
| `jitml-haskell-style` | `test/haskell-style/Main.hs` runs the lint stack, including external formatter, HLint, cabal-format, and warning-clean build gates; target style tools are supplied by the `jitml:local` image build rather than host lint-time bootstrap | Style (§Style as a Cabal test-suite) | Sprint 1.4 |
| `jitml-purescript-style` | `test/purescript-style/Main.hs` checks the generated PureScript contract file, renderer, recursive checked-in PureScript whitespace shape, panel-contract coverage, and explicit typed `spago test` / `purs-tidy check` command shapes | Lint (project-specific) | Sprint 11.3 |

Each stanza is `type: exitcode-stdio-1.0` with `tasty` as the in-stanza
runner. A single `tasty` tree spanning all tiers is forbidden per doctrine
`Test Organization`.

## Doctrine Category → Stanza Mapping

| Doctrine Test Category | Owning Stanza |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Pure Logic | `jitml-unit` |
| Parser | `jitml-unit` |
| Property | `jitml-unit` |
| Golden | `jitml-unit` |
| Integration | `jitml-integration`, `jitml-sl-canonicals`, `jitml-rl-canonicals`, `jitml-hyperparameter`, `jitml-cross-backend` |
| Daemon Lifecycle | `jitml-daemon-lifecycle` |
| Pulumi-Orchestrated Infrastructure | `jitml-e2e` |
| Style (§Style as a Cabal test-suite) | `jitml-haskell-style` |
| Lint (project-specific) | `jitml-purescript-style` |

The four `*-canonicals`/HPO/cross-backend rows are **project-specific
Integration** stanzas under doctrine §Test Organization's project-specific
stanzas allowance — extensions of the Integration category, not parallel
test systems. `jitml-purescript-style` is a **project-specific Lint**
stanza under the same allowance.

`jitml test all` (Sprint `12.9`) fans out to every stanza above by invoking
`cabal test all` through the typed `Subprocess` boundary, then renders a
target-stanza report card after Cabal succeeds. `jitml test <stanza>` renders
the same report shape for the selected stanza only. Because
`jitml-haskell-style` uses
container-provided style tools, the full all-stanza gate runs inside
`jitml:local` unless `JITML_STYLE_TOOLS_BIN` points at prebuilt host tools.
The 2026-05-19 `jitml:local` validation passed non-dry-run `jitml test all`
across all ten stanzas and printed the report card with the `cabal.project`
knob values; the current local renderer names the target stanzas rather than
fixed placeholder workload PASS rows.
`jitml test <stanza>` invokes one Cabal stanza through the same boundary.

## Project-Specific Stanza Notes

### `jitml-sl-canonicals` — SL canon coverage

The current body exercises the eleven local canonical cells from
`src/JitML/SL/Canonicals.hs`, verifies each synthetic convergence curve is
deterministic, and asserts the final synthetic loss improves over the initial
loss. It also checks every current deterministic curve against the committed
fixture under `test/golden/sl/<problem-key>/curve.txt`. Live measured
training transcript byte equality remains target runtime validation.

### `jitml-rl-canonicals` — RL canon coverage

The current body checks representative entries in `algorithmCatalog`, verifies
`deterministicTrajectory` is stable for a fixed algorithm and seed, compares the
PPO/CartPole trajectory to `test/golden/rl/ppo/cartpole/trajectory.txt`, and
checks the local Connect 4, Othello, Hex, and Gomoku transcript helpers against
`test/golden/alphazero/<game>-transcript.txt`. Environment rollouts, policy
training, reward-distribution fixtures, and live AlphaZero arena measurements
remain target validation.

### `jitml-hyperparameter` — sampler / scheduler / pruner reproducibility

The current body checks the local `Grid`, `Sobol`, `Random`, `TPE`, `GPBO`,
`GeneticAlgorithm`, `NSGA2`, `MuLambdaES`, `CMAES`, `EvolutionStrategies`,
and `PBT` samplers; `Fifo`, `SuccessiveHalving`, `Hyperband`, and `ASHA`
schedulers; and `NoPruner`, `MedianPruner`, and `PercentilePruner` pruners.
It verifies deterministic local trial values, sampler-label parsing, the
current Sobol/GA golden fixtures, and the `experiments/mnist-tune.dhall` TPE
worked-example decode. Live trial persistence and resume-from-partial-sweep
equality against MinIO remain target validation.

### `jitml-cross-backend` and the Tolerance Band

The current body checks that every local substrate has deterministic engine
flags and that the local `inferFromManifest` helper returns the same summary
for every substrate. It also compiles the generated Linux CPU identity kernel,
loads `jitml_kernel` with `dlopen`, and asserts three successive FFI runs return
bit-identical fixture output. Live cross-substrate graph-kernel launches and
cross-substrate tolerance fixtures under `test/golden/cross-backend/` remain the
final handoff validation gate.

### `jitml-daemon-lifecycle`

The current body exercises local lifecycle ordering, renderable endpoint
responses, retry policy behavior, payload-hash deduplication, and one-shot
HTTP serving for `/healthz`. It also covers the `JitML.Service.Signal` mapping:
`SIGHUP` increments reload generation, while `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` begin drain
and make readiness false. Real Pulsar redelivery remains target runtime
validation.

### `jitml-e2e` and Pulumi

The current `jitml-e2e` body validates local route, bucket, `chart/values.yaml`
MinIO coverage, publication, browser-contract, demo HTTP routes including the
generated stream endpoints, deployment, report-card rendering plus the
`cabal.project` knob-block parser, typed live-plan surfaces, no leaked
`jitml-e2e-*` Kind clusters when `kind` and `/var/run/docker.sock` are both
available, and the bundle-serving fallback. When the binary or Docker socket is
absent, only the local Docker-backed Kind query is skipped. The Pulumi
TypeScript program at
`infra/pulumi/`
contains a typed `@pulumi/command` resource graph for Kind creation, Helm
dependency build, `jitml bootstrap`, publication checking, and symmetric Kind
deletion. The live driver is an explicit command path, not a process-environment
gate or part of default `cabal test all`, because it creates and destroys Kind,
builds Helm dependencies, mutates
image/runtime state, and polls live routes.
Future live test driver:

1. A typed `helm dependency build chart` step prepares subchart dependencies
   before any apply. `Chart.lock` becomes part of the reproducible surface only
   if the project adopts committed chart dependency locking.
2. `pulumi up` brings up the stack (Kind cluster, Helm chart in its `final`
   phase against a temporary registry image pushed during the run, plus the
   `jitml-demo` Deployment).
3. The driver runs `jitml train`, `jitml rl train`, `jitml tune` against the
   ephemeral stack to seed the demo state.
4. The driver invokes the Playwright suite from
   [../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/phase-11-purescript-frontend-and-demo.md → Sprint
   11.6](../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN/phase-11-purescript-frontend-and-demo.md)
   against the live bundle across the six demo cohorts (training control,
   MNIST handwriting, image upload, Connect 4 game-play, TensorBoard/Grafana
   navigation, hyperparameter sweep).
5. `pulumi destroy` and a teardown audit (no orphan PVs, MinIO buckets,
   Harbor projects, or Docker volumes survive).

Future Pulumi invocations flow through the typed `Subprocess` boundary.

### `jitml-haskell-style`

Doctrine's Style stanza per §Style as a Cabal test-suite. The target body runs
the lint stack with style tools prebuilt by the mandatory `jitml:local` image,
including route-registry / chart consistency lint, generated-section drift
checks, `fourmolu --mode check`, `hlint --with-group=default
--with-group=extra` plus `.hlint.yaml`, `cabal format` temp-file round-trip byte
equality, and the warning-clean build gate. This stanza uses prebuilt
container-owned style tools and does not bootstrap missing tools through host
`ghcup`.

### `jitml-purescript-style`

Project-specific Lint extension under doctrine §Test Organization's
project-specific stanzas allowance. The current body checks that
`web/src/Generated/Contracts.purs` exists and names the expected endpoint
surface, that the local Haskell renderer emits the module header, that panel
metadata is covered by generated contracts, and that the explicit
`spago test` and `purs-tidy check "src/**/*.purs"` commands are represented as
typed `Subprocess` values. Default `purs format` round-trip and
`purescript-spec` smoke tests remain target work.

### Playwright

Playwright belongs to the doctrine's target Pulumi-Orchestrated Infrastructure
test category. The current repository has `playwright/jitml-demo.spec.ts` as a
scaffold. The default `jitml-e2e` body validates the typed Playwright plan and
the current inline DOM stub spec without invoking the live stack. Live
edge-route Playwright execution waits until panels
consume fixture-backed or live-backed state through `jitml-demo`; static
route/API scaffold checks stay in the local Haskell e2e and PureScript-style
stanzas.

### Property Invariants

Per doctrine `Test Categories → Property Tests`, every codec exposes the
canonical invariants:

- `decode . encode == id`
- `render is deterministic`
- `parser roundtrips`

Current checked coverage applies these invariants to the local parser, renderers,
route registry, cache helpers, checkpoint key/CAS/store helpers, runtime-source
renderers, numerical/RL Dhall catalog mirrors, local catalog helpers, and the
current route/Grafana/tuning/RL golden fixtures.
Transcript codecs, manifest CBOR, protobuf schemas, generated Grafana fixtures,
and richer numerical-core Dhall round-trips remain target validation.

### Golden Tests and Sentinel Placeholders

Golden fixtures live under `test/golden/`. Non-deterministic content (wall-
clock readings, hostnames, timestamps) is replaced with sentinel placeholders
per doctrine `Test Categories → Golden Tests`.
